This is an example program from the "Protocol Buffers and gRPC in Go" talk I
gave at the Edmonton Go meetup on 23 Jan 2017. It's a Twitter-like service with
a gRPC API and a really ugly webapp.

The Makefile will build everything, but you will need to have `protoc` and the
gRPC plugin installed first. You can find instructions on the
[gRPC website](http://www.grpc.io/docs/quickstart/go.html).
